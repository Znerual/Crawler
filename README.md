#Crawler

A game made with the Blender Game Engine. Is was a small project to all the steps necessary to produce a final video game.
All the assets are made by myself, except the music, which is copyright free music from the net.

The Levelbuilder was written is Java and is meant to be used to create and change the Level file in the folder. The level can freely be modified, just be carefull not to make it too hard ;)
